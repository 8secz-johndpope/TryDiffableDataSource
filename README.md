iOS 13 bring a whole new way of loading UITableview and UICollectionViews.

**DiffableDataSource** is completely new approach to change your tableview data with all basic operations with less code. Instead of _performbatchupdates_ it has a simple method called **apply**.

**Key concept**

+ Snapshot, truth of UI state, no more indexPaths, unique identifiers for sections and items
+ Identifiers, must be uniquea and conforms to hashable
+ `dataSource.apply()` replace `perfomBatchUpdates()`
+ See `UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource` and `UITableViewDiffableDataSource`

**What is a Snapshot???**
It is the current state of the UI. It has unique identifier for sections and items. One of the thing you might like is â€” It does not have indexPaths.
